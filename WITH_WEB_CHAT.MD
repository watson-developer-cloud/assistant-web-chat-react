# Using withWebChat

The `WebChatContainer` component, makes use of the `withWebChat` function to create high-order-components that inject a function for creating instances of web chat. This document explains how to use that function if you wish to bypass the `WebChatContainer`.

## Using withWebChat

This HOC allows you to inject a property called `createWebChatInstance` as a prop to a given React component.  The `createWebChatInstance` method takes a [web chat configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#configurationobject) as an argument and returns an [instance](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-instance-methods) of the web chat that you can now access inside your React application. Making the `instance` available for use inside your React component makes it easy for your React application and web chat to work in harmony, including allowing you to render React content inside web chat via [React portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html). Once you have an `instance` you can pass it into child components as a property or via context. You should not call `createWebChatInstance` again to access the `instance`, as it will create a *new* instance if you do so.

### With a functional component

With a functional component, you can use the `useEffect` React hook to call the `createWebChatInstance` method provided as a prop.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { withWebChat } from '@ibm-watson/assistant-web-chat-react';

const MyLocation = ({ location, createWebChatInstance }) => {

  useEffect(() => {
    function onWebChatLoad(instance) {
      instance.render();
    }

    // A web chat configuration options object as documented at https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#configurationobject
    const webChatOptions = {
      integrationID: 'XXXX',
      region: 'XXXX',
      serviceInstanceID: 'XXXX',
      onLoad: onWebChatLoad
    };

    createWebChatInstance(webChatOptions);
  }, []);

  return <div>I am here in {location}!</div>;
};

// Wrap the component with the method returned by `withWebChat`.
export default withWebChat()(MyLocation);
```

You can now use the `MyLocation` component like you would any other. You can pass through any props you want, and `withWebChat` adds `createWebChatInstance` to the props.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import MyLocation from './MyLocation';

// Notice we only pass in the "location" prop to the MyLocation component... "createWebChatInstance" is automatically added!
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Where are you located?</div>
      <MyLocation location="Boston" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With a class component

With a class-based component, you can use `componentDidMount` to call the `createWebChatInstance` method provided as a prop.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyLocation extends Component {

  // A web chat configuration options object as documented at https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#configurationobject
  webChatOptions = {
    integrationID: 'XXXX',
    region: 'XXXX',
    serviceInstanceID: 'XXXX',
    onLoad: this.onWebChatLoad
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    const { createWebChatInstance } = this.props;
    createWebChatInstance(this.webChatOptions).then(instance => { this.onWebChatLoad(instance); });
  }

  onWebChatLoad = (instance) => {
    instance.render();
  };

  render() {
    const { location } = this.props;
    return <div>I am here in {location}!</div>;
  }
}

export default withWebChat()(MyLocation);
```

You can now use the `MyLocation` component like you would any other. You can pass through any props you want, and `withWebChat` will add `createWebChatInstance` to the props.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import MyLocation from './MyLocation';

// Notice we only pass in the "location" prop to the MyLocation component... "createWebChatInstance" is automatically added!
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Where are you located?</div>
        <MyLocation location="Boston" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
### Writing tests

It is recommended that you mock `createWebChatInstance` in your unit tests and not test the higher-order component. If you must include the higher-order component in your unit test, you might have to add some extra configuration to your unit test framework to account for the fact that web chat appends additional scripts to your web site.

For example, when using the [Jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io), you must add the following configuration to your `jest.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    resources: 'usable',
    runScripts: 'dangerously',
  },
};
```

## Using with TypeScript

This library is written in TypeScript and includes types.
In addition to `withWebChat`, this package exports the following types:

| Type                  | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AddedWithWebChatProps | The props that the withWebChat component adds to the component that is passed to it. |
| WebChatConfig         | The configuration options object to create a new web chat instance.                  |
| WebChatInstance       | The created instance of web chat.                                                    |
| WithWebChatConfig     | The optional configuration object for withWebChat                                    |

```typescript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { 
  withWebChat,
  AddedWithWebChatProps,
  WebChatConfig,
  WebChatInstance,
  WithWebChatConfig
} from '@ibm-watson/assistant-web-chat-react';

interface MyLocationProps extends AddedWithWebChatProps {
  location: string;
}

const withWebChatConfig: WithWebChatConfig = {
  debug: true
};

const MyLocation = ({ location, createWebChatInstance }: MyLocationProps) => {
  useEffect(() => {

    function onWebChatLoad(instance: WebChatInstance) {
      instance.render();
    }

    // A web chat configuration options object as documented at https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#configurationobject
    const webChatOptions: WebChatConfig = {
      integrationID: 'XXXX',
      region: 'XXXX',
      serviceInstanceID: 'XXXX',
      onLoad: onWebChatLoad
    };

    createWebChatInstance(webChatOptions);
  }, []);

  return <div>I am here in {location}!</div>;
};

// Wrap the component with the method returned by `withWebChat`.
export default withWebChat(withWebChatConfig)(MyLocation);

```

## API

### withWebChat

The `withWebChat` method is a higher-order function that returns a higher-order component. It takes an optional configuration argument and returns a function that takes a component as an argument. This component will have `createWebChatInstance` injected as a prop.

```javascript
// enchance is the higher order component.
const enhance = withWebChat(options);

// enhance takes the component as an argument and adds createWebChatInstance as a prop.
export default enhance(Component)
```

or in short form:

```javascript
export default withWebChat(options)(Component)
```

This syntax enables you to chain multiple higher-order components together. [See the higher-order components documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) from the React team for more information about how higher-order components work and how they can be composed together.

#### withWebChat options object

The `withWebChat` method takes an optional object as an argument. Most uses will never use these.

| Attribute | Required | Default                                                  | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| debug     | No       | false                                                    | boolean | If set to true, adds logging for setup and tear down process of web chat. Helpful for seeing if your application is aggressively mounting and remounting web chat. |
| baseUrl   | No       | https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud | string  | Where externally loaded script for web chat are hosted. Used for internal development purposes.                                                                    |

### createWebChatInstance

The `createWebChatInstance` method takes a [web chat configuration options object](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#configurationobject) as an argument and returns a promise. This promise either will successfully resolve with the instance of the web chat, or will throw a descriptive error.

```javascript
createWebChatInstance(config).then(instance => {}).catch(error => {});
```
